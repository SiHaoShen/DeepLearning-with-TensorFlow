## Exercise 1 Questions

This week you explored a reduced version of the Cats v Dogs dataset and used it to train a convolutional neural network. You saw that it overfit very quickly, despite great results with the training set. One solution to overfitting is to use more data for both training and validation, and that’s this week’s exercise -- to build a classifier using the full Cats v Dogs dataset of 25k images!

Note again that when loading the images, you might get warnings about EXIF data being missing or corrupt. Don't worry about this -- it is missing data in the images, but it's not visual data that will impact the training.

Let's start building a classifier using the full Cats v Dogs dataset of 25k images.
