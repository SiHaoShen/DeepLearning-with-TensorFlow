## Exercise 3 Questions

In class you learned about RNNs and LSTMs for prediction, as well as a simple methodology to pick a decent learning rate for the stochastic gradient descent optimizer. In this exercise youâ€™ll take a synthetic data set and write the code to pick the learning rate and then train on it to get an MAE of smaller than 3
