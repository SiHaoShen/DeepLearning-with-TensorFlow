## Exercise 1 Questions

Great! You’ve come a long way already! Now it’s time to do an exercise in programming. Earlier this week you saw a ‘Hello World’ in Machine Learning that predicted a relationship between X and Y values. These were purely arbitrary, but it did give you the template for how you can solve more difficult problems. So, for this exercise you will write code that does a similar task -- in this case predicting house prices based on a simple, linear equation.
